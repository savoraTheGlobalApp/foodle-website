                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    
                    <p class="story-intro">Foodle was born from one simple (and slightly hangry) frustration—why is finding good food so hard?</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-origin">Foodle is created by IIT Kanpur college friends to solve a simple yet frustrating problem—finding good food outlets and deciding menu at home. We've all been there—scrolling endlessly for the perfect place to eat generic reviews and impersonal recommendations, having or struggling to follow scattered recipes without proper guidance.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-solution">So, we built Foodle—a platform where you can discover great food, share your food moments, cook with home cooks and chefs, and learn from global food content. To make it even more exciting, we introduced rewards and games, turning food into an adventure.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-community">But Foodle is more than just an app—it's a community. A place where food lovers, home cooks, and culinary explorers come together to share, learn, and celebrate the joy of food.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-invitation">What started as a solution to our own problem is now a global movement, helping people explore, cook, and enjoy food like never before. Join us and be part of the Foodle journey!</p>
