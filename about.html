                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Foodle was born from a simple frustration: finding great places to eat shouldn't be so difficult. Our founders, avid food enthusiasts themselves, were tired of scrolling through generic reviews and impersonal recommendations.</p>
                    <p>In 2022, after a particularly disappointing dining experience based on a highly-rated online review, our team came together with a mission to create something betterâ€”a platform that truly understands food preferences and connects people through their love of culinary experiences.</p>
                    <p>What started as a small project among friends has grown into a passionate team dedicated to revolutionizing how people discover and share food experiences.</p>
